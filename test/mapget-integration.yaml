# Integration config for mapget when running erdblick Playwright tests.
#
# This file is loaded by the Playwright global setup via:
#   mapget --config test/mapget-integration.yaml serve ...
#
# The `sources` list can be extended with deterministic test datasources
# (e.g. DataSourceProcess using the cpp-sample-http-datasource example)
# without changing the Playwright harness.

sources:
  # HTTP datasource example using the cpp-sample-http-datasource from mapget.
  # This assumes that the `cpp-sample-http-datasource` binary is on PATH
  # (or runnable via the shell used to start `mapget`). If it is not
  # available, mapget will log an error and simply expose no sources; the
  # Playwright tests that depend on Tropico will detect this and skip.
