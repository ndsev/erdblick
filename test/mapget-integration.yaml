# Integration config for mapget when running erdblick Playwright tests.
#
# This file is loaded by the Playwright global setup via:
#   mapget --config test/mapget-integration.yaml serve ...
#
# The `sources` list can be extended with deterministic test datasources
# (e.g. additional DataSourceProcess entries) without changing the
# Playwright harness.

sources:
  # Python example datasource from the vendored mapget repo.
  # This assumes that a `python` executable is available and that the
  # `mapget` Python package can be imported (for example via
  # `pip install mapget` in the active environment). If the script cannot
  # be started, mapget will log an error and simply expose no sources; the
  # Playwright tests that depend on this datasource will detect its absence
  # from `/sources` and skip.
