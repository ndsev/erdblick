# erdblick üåç

`erdblick` is a dynamic mapviewer built on the `mapget` feature service.

> **Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è**: Erdblick is still under active development and hasn't reached its final form. However, we'd love to hear your feedback during this phase.

**Capabilities:** üõ†Ô∏è

* üó∫Ô∏è View map layers from a specific [`mapget`](https://github.com/klebert-engineering/mapget) server.
* üé® Define visual styles for map layers through style-sheets, translating specific features into visual elements in both 2D and 3D.
* üèîÔ∏è Experience 3D features and terrains with a flexible 3D camera powered by [CesiumJS](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/).
* ‚úçÔ∏è Edit map layer style sheets in real-time directly from the front-end **(Planned)**.
* üîç Select multiple features at once using filter or lasso selection tools **(Planned)**.
* üñºÔ∏è Utilize split-screen panes for optional overlay or synchronized navigation with an adjustable splitter **(Planned)**.
* üîé View multiple map layer tile zoom levels all at once **(Planned)**.

## Setup

Ready to try out the latest version? 
While the Desktop app is still work-in-progress, swing by the [Release Page](https://github.com/Klebert-Engineering/erdblick/releases) to grab the newest build. 
Currently, `erdblick` is made to be served by a [`mapget`](https://github.com/klebert-engineering/mapget) server, 
so make sure to serve it up with the `mapget serve` command. 
Not sure how to do that? Start off with a simple `pip install mapget` and then fire away with 
```bash
mapget serve -w <path-to-unpacked-erdblick>
```

If you would like to build erdblick from its source code, you would need to install the required dependencies 
and run the following commands prior to starting up a mapget server:
```bash
cd <path-to-cloned-repo>
npm install
ng build
```

#### Required dependencies

To sucessfully build from the source code, the following dependencies are prerequisite:

| Dependency | Version |
|------------|---------|
| Node.js    | 21.3.0+ |
| npm        | 10.2.4+ |

## Styling System

Erdblick styles are defined as *YAML*-files, which must have a `rules` key that contains an array of
feature visualisation rule objects. During runtime, a feature will be visualised according to each
rule that matches it.

<summary>Show details</summary>

> **Note ‚ö†Ô∏è:** While the mature product envisions a rich UI with the ability
> to edit and toggle multiple style sheets, the current alpha version loads
> its style sheet from the hard-coded path [static/styles/demo-style.yaml](static/styles/demo-style.yaml).

Each rule within the YAML `rules` array can have the following fields. Any field marked with __`*`__ is optional:

| Field                 | Description                                                                                          | Type                                                       | Example Value        |

| `width`__*__          | Specifies the line width or point diameter (default in pixels).                                      | Float                                                      | `4.5`                |

| `near-far-scale`__*__ | For points, indicate (`near-alt-meters`, `near-scale`, `far-alt-meters`, `far-scale`).               | Array of four Floats.                                      | `[1.5e2,10,8.0e6,0]` |
| `first-of`__*__       | Mark a rule as a parent of a fallback rule list. See description below.                              | Array of Rule objects.                                     | See example below.   |

**About `first-of`:**

Normally, all style rules from a style sheet are naively applied to all matching features.
However, usually, it will be sufficient if only the first matching rule from a list
is applied. This allows a simple fallback rule at the bottom of the list. For this purpose,
the `first-of` style rule field exists. It may be applied as follows:

```yaml
rules:
- type: Road
  first-of:
    - (subrule-1...)
    - (subrule-2...)
    - (subrule-n)
```

Note, that all attributes except for `type`, `filter` and `first-of` are propagated
from the parent rule to the subrules. For example, a parent rule `color` will be applied
to the child, unless the child overrides the color. It is explicitly allowed
that sub-rules may have sub-rules themselves.

**A brief example:**

```yaml
rules:
  - geometry:
      - point
      - mesh
    type: "Landmark"
    filter: "properties.someProperty == someValue"
    color: "#FF5733"
    opacity: 0.8
    width: 4.5
  - geometry:
      - line
      - polygon
    type: "Boundary"
    color: "#33FF57"
```

## Build instructions (Linux-only)

<details>
<summary>Show instructions</summary>

Run the setup script once to pull Emscripten SDK:

```bash
./ci/00_linux_setup.bash
```

To build the project, run:

```bash
./ci/10_linux_build.bash
```

To rebuild the project (skipping checkouts and CMake initialization), run:

```bash
./ci/20_linux_rebuild.bash
```

You can also build the `erdblick-core` library with a standard C++ compiler
in an IDE of your choice. This is also useful to run the unit-tests.
