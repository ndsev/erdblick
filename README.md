# erdblick üåç

`erdblick` is a dynamic mapviewer built on the `mapget` feature service.

> **Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è**: Erdblick is still under active development and hasn't reached its final form. However, we'd love to hear your feedback during this phase.

**Capabilities:** üõ†Ô∏è

* üó∫Ô∏è View map layers from a specific [`mapget`](https://github.com/klebert-engineering/mapget) server.
* üé® Define visual styles for map layers through style-sheets, translating specific features into visual elements in both 2D and 3D.
* üèîÔ∏è Experience 3D features and terrains with a flexible 3D camera powered by [CesiumJS](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/).
* ‚úçÔ∏è Edit map layer style sheets in real-time directly from the front-end **(Planned)**.
* üîç Select multiple features at once using filter or lasso selection tools **(Planned)**.
* üñºÔ∏è Utilize split-screen panes for optional overlay or synchronized navigation with an adjustable splitter **(Planned)**.
* üîé View multiple map layer tile zoom levels all at once **(Planned)**.

## Setup

Ready to try out the latest version? 
While the Desktop app is still work-in-progress, swing by the [Release Page](https://github.com/Klebert-Engineering/erdblick/releases) to grab the newest build. 
Currently, `erdblick` is made to be served by a [`mapget`](https://github.com/klebert-engineering/mapget) server, 
so make sure to serve it up with the `mapget serve` command. 
Not sure how to do that? Start off with a simple `pip install mapget` and then fire away with 
```bash
mapget serve -w <path-to-unpacked-erdblick>
```

## Styling System

Erdblick styles are defined as *YAML*-files, which must have a `rules` key that contains an array of
feature visualisation rule objects. During runtime, a feature will be visualised according to each
rule that matches it.

### Custom Style Declarations

It is possible to apply own custom styles easily. 
On build, Erdblick automatically picks up `.yaml` style files from `styles` directory (where you can drop your custom files) 
and bundles them in `static/bundle/styles` (in case you are using a pre-built Erdblick distribution, 
you can directly put your styles in `static/bundle/styles`).

For Erdblick to apply custom styles, it expects the following declarations for the styles in `config/config.json` 
(in case you are using a pre-built Erdblick distribution, you can directly create your configuration in `static/config.json`):
```json
{
   "styles": [
       { "id": "Your Style ID", "url": "style.yaml" },
       { "id": "Your Style ID2", "url": "style_2.yaml" }
   ]
}
```
where `url` field must be a path relative to `static/bundle/styles` and `id` is used to identify the particular style in GUI.

It is also possible to export and import styles in GUI. Styles imported this way will persist in the local storage of the browser.

### Editing Styles via Erdblick

Both bundled and imported styles can be modified directly via a GUI editor included in Erdblick.
If a style was modified this way, it will persist in the `local storage` of the browser 
(if the `local storage` is cleared or reset, all of the modifications will be reset as well; 
in case you would like to clear the styles yourself, you can do that via the preferences panel.

The style editor automatically verifies YAML for syntax parsing errors and provides basic autocomplete. 

### Style Definitions

Each rule within the YAML `rules` array can have the following fields:

| Field                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Type                                                       | Example Value                  |

### Labels in Erdblick

In Erdblick, labels are used to add textual information to the visualized geometries.
Labels are always visualized in addition to the geometry itself and are positioned at
the visual center of the geometry. For a label to be displayed, the `label-text` or
`label-text-expression` property must be set in the style definition.
When set, Erdblick renders the label according to the defined style properties,
such as `label-color`, `label-font`, `label-scale`, etc.

Labels can be applied to any geometry type and are particularly useful for providing contextual information,
such as names, identifiers, or any other relevant data associated with the feature.

**Label Example:**

```yaml
rules:
  - geometry:
      - point
      - line
    type: "City|Road"
    color: "#FF5733"
    label-text-expression: "**.name"
    label-color: "white"
    label-outline-color: "black"
    label-font: "14px Arial"
    label-style: "FILL"
    label-scale: 1.2
```

In this example, labels are applied to both point and line geometries representing
cities and roads. The label text is dynamically generated from the feature's name
attribute. The labels are styled with a white fill color, a black outline, and are
scaled up by a factor of 1.2 for better visibility.

### Relation Styling

In Erdblick, relation styling is used to visualize relationships between different features.
This is especially useful for illustrating connections, flows, or hierarchies between elements in the map.
A rule is run for all relations of a matching feature by setting `aspect: relation`.
The geometric primitive that is used to visualize the relation is a line from the center
of the source validity geometry (the default validity is first source feature geometry) to the center
of the target validity geometry. The visualized relations may be filtered by type name
using the `relation-type` regular expression.

For relations, style expressions (e.g. `color-expression`) are evaluated in a context which has the following variables:

* `$source`: Source feature.
* `$target`: Target feature.
* `$twoway`: Variable indicating whether the relation is bidirectional.
* `name`: Name of the relation type.
* `sourceValidity`: Source validity geometry if set.
* `targetValidity`: Target validity geometry if set.

When visualizing relations recursively using a rule that has
the `highlight` mode, the recursion will be performed
until the selected feature tile's border is reached. Any
relations across the border are then resolved once using
a mapget `locate`-call.

**Relation Styling Example:**

```yaml
rules:
  - type: LaneGroup
    aspect: relation
    mode: highlight
    color: red
    width: 20
    arrow: double
    opacity: 0.9
    relation-type: "nextLaneGroup|prevLaneGroup"
    relation-recursive: true
    relation-merge-twoway: true
    relation-line-height-offset: 10
    relation-line-end-markers:
      color: black
      width: 4
```

### Attribute Styling

Using `aspect: attribute`, a styling rule can be used to visualize feature attributes
that are stored in attribute layers. The rule will then be used to visualize the validity
geometry of the attribute, or the attribute's feature's first geometry as a fallback.
The visualized attributes may be filtered using the `attribute-type` and `attribute-layer-type`
regular expressions.

For attributes, style expressions (e.g. `color-expression`) are evaluated in a context which has the following variables:

* `$feature`: The feature of the attribute.
* `$layer`: The layer name of the attribute.
* `direction`: Attribute direction if set.
* `validity`: Attribute validity geometry if set.
* (Additional value fields of the attribute, e.g. `speedLimitKmh`)

### About `first-of`

Normally, all style rules from a style sheet are naively applied to all matching features.
However, usually, it will be sufficient if only the first matching rule from a list


is applied. This allows a simple fallback rule at the bottom of the list. For this purpose,
the `first-of` style rule field exists. It may be applied as follows:

```yaml
rules:
- type: Road
  first-of:
    - (subrule-1...)
    - (subrule-2...)
    - (subrule-n)
```

Note that all attributes except for `type`, `filter`, and `first-of` are propagated
from the parent rule to the subrules. For example, a parent rule `color` will be applied
to the child, unless the child overrides the color. It is explicitly allowed
that sub-rules may have sub-rules themselves.

**A brief example:**

```yaml
rules:
  - geometry:
      - point
      - mesh
    aspect: "feature"
    mode: "normal"
    type: "Landmark"
    filter: "properties.someProperty == someValue"
    color: "#FF5733"
    opacity: 0.8
    width: 4.5
  - geometry:
      - line
      - polygon
    aspect: "relation"
    mode: "highlight"
    type: "Boundary"
    color: "#33FF57"
```
